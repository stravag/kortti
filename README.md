# HTMX Pet Project

This is a simple sandbox/pet project to fumble with server side rendering.
I added [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/), but it still looks like ass
#backenddevproblems.

Makes use of:

* HTMX https://htmx.org
* Spring Boot https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
* JTE https://jte.gg
* Playwright https://playwright.dev

The JTE templates are Java templates: I would prefer to use Kotlin, but unfortunately,
the [JTE IntelliJ plugin no longer works](https://github.com/casid/jte-intellij/issues/49)
with Kotlin at the moment.
